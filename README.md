# Probability-of-Next-3-word-Generation
The Probability of Next 3-Word Prediction project uses an LSTM model to predict the next three words in a sequence. Trained on a corpus of 19,122 unique words from 48,320 words, the model applied data preprocessing techniques like tokenization, one-hot encoding,etc .The model was integrated with a Flask backend and deployed as a responsive web app.
